-- Random unit descriptions we can show
local unit_descs = {
	"armck.dds Construction Kbot is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander and advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solars and most importantly the T2 Kbot lab. It is slightly slower and weaker than vehicle constructor, but it can climb steeper hills, so it is effective in expansion on mountainous terrain.",
	"armflea.dds Fleas are supercheap and fast to build Kbots used for scouting and damaging the early eco structures of enemies. It is faster than all Kbots and most vehicles but any close confrontation will be lethal to it. Evade laser towers and destroy metal extractors to slow down your foeâ€™s expansion!",
	"armham.dds Hammer is a plasma Kbot that can deal a sizeable damage with relatively low cost of building. It has slightly higher HP than rocket Kbots, hence it can be used in big numbers to destroy T1 defensive structures. Combine with resurrection Kbots (Rectors), for an effective front push. Useful for defending mountain tops.",
	"armjeth.dds Jethro is a cheap amphibious mobile anti-air (AA) Kbot, that can easily take down light aircrafts. Always send a few with your army to protect it from EMP drones/gunships. It has no land-to-land weapons.",
	"armpw.dds Peewee is a basic infantry Kbot. Being very cheap to build and having high top speeds can be useful for scouting and taking down unguarded metal extractors and eco. In late T1 warfare Peewees can be used for ambushing Commanders and speedy skirmishing.",
	"armrectr.dds Rector is a resurrection Kbot which can turn wrecks into brand new army members or reclaim them to get back your metal! It is fast and cheap to build, therefore it works great for reclaiming trees, rocks etc. Good for repairing damaged units too.",
	"armrock.dds Rocko is a light rocket Kbot used mainly to push the frontline towards opponent's base. It can outrange light laser turrets. Not effective against mobile units, watch out for A.K./Peewees!",
	"armwar.dds Warrior is a durable Kbot armed with a rapid firing double laser. It has a relatively high HP for T1 and can easily take down multiple light assault units. Always combine with resurrection Kbots for healing and resurrecting fallen ones.",
	"corak.dds A.K. is a light infantry Kbot which is cheap and quick to build. Proves useful for scouting and taking down unguarded structures like metal extractors and early eco. It is armed with light, but precise laser with a little longer range than PeeWee, so with  little microing skills you can outrange them eaisily.",
	"corcrash.dds Crasher is a cheap amphibious mobile anti-air (AA) Kbot, that can easily take down light aircrafts. Always send a few with your army to protect it from EMP drones/gunships. It has no land-to-land weapons.",
	"corstorm.dds Storm is a light rocket Kbot used to push the frontline towards opponent's base. It can outrange light laser turrets. Hopeless against fast mobile units. Slower, but stronger than ARM counterparts.",
	"cornecro.dds Necro is a resurrection Kbot which can turn wrecks into brand new army members or reclaim them to get back your metal! It is fast and cheap to build, therefore it works great for reclaiming trees, rocks etc. Good for repairing damaged units too.",
	"corthud.dds Thud is a plasma Kbot that can deal a sizeable damage with relatively low cost of building. It has a shorter range than rocket Kbots. Combine with resurrection Kbots (Necros), for healing and resurrecting fallen ones, to quickly push the frontline. Useful for defending mountain tops.",
	"armfav.dds Jeffies are supercheap and fast to build vehicles used for scouting and damaging the early eco structures. It is the fastest moving unit in the whole game but due to light armor any close confrontation will be lethal to it. Evade laser towers and destroy metal extractors to slow down your foe's expansion.",
	"armflash.dds Flash is a light, fast moving tank with close combat rapid fire weapon. It is slightly more powerful and faster than Peewee and A.K. on flat terrain. Being very cheap to build and having high top speeds can be useful for scouting and taking down unguarded metal extractors and eco.",
	"armart.dds Shellshocker is an artillery vehicle used to take down T1 defenses, esp. High Laser Turrets. It can outrange all T1 defense towers. Always keep them protected by Stumpies/Flashes, or your own defensive structures. Don't forget to have targets in your radar's range or scouted.",
	"armbeaver.dds Beaver is an amphibious construction vehicle, which can travel on land and underwater equally well allowing easy expansion between islands, under rivers and across seas. Its build menu includes some water based units like underwater metal extractors, tidal generators and most importantly the amphibious complex.",
	"armcv.dds",
	"armjanus.dds",
	"armmlv.dds",
	"armpincer.dds",
	"armsam.dds",
	"armstump.dds",
	"armatlas.dds Atlas is an airborne transportation unit. It can pick up all T1 land based units and T2, with exception of heavy ones, like Fatboy or Goliath. Use it for unexpected unit drops bypassing your enemy's defense line. Can be used for transporting nano towers too.",
	"armca.dds Construction Aircraft is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander plus advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Aircraft Plant. Due to its speed it may be used for quick expansion and reclaiming in areas far from your base. Due to little build power you may want to use multiple air cons at once.",
	"armfig.dds Freedom Fighter is a fast moving fighter jet that is designed for eliminating air units. It is the most effective form of T1 air defense. Always put your fighters on patrol in front of your base, so they attack any hostile aircraft moving in the vicinity. Send fighters with your bombing runs to disable opponent's fighter wall.",
	"armkam.dds Banshee is a light gunship that can deal damage to land based units. It has very weak armor, that can be quickly shattered by T1 anti-air, so always send them in packs and scout before striking. It is a weapon of surprise, try to keep it away from your foe's radars. An effective attacking order is: nano towers -> AA towers and units -> eco and labs.",
	"armpeep.dds Peeper is a cheap and fast moving air scout, that is not armed with any weapons, but a huge line of sight. It is used to gain intelligence on what your enemy is planning, and where he keeps his most important units. In late-game a constant stream of scouts helps your artillery units, improving their aim.",
	"armthund.dds Thunder is a bomber, designed mainly for destroying buildings. A little bit weaker than its CORE counterpart - Shadow. It can strike every 9 seconds. Always scout first and combine with fighters to eliminate enemy's airwall before  bombing. Click A for attack and drag your RMB to execute a carpet bombing",
