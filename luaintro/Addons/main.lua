-- Random tips we can show
local tips = {"Tip #1:\n\nHave trouble finding metal spots?\nPress F4 to switch to the metal map.",
"Tip #:\n\nYou can queue-up multiple consecutive unit actions by holding SHIFT.",
"Tip #2: \n\nYou can tweak graphic preferences in options - in top right corner of the screen.\nWhen your FPS drops, switch to a lower graphic preset.",
"Tip #3: \n\nRadars are cheap, make them early in the game to effectively counter initial strikes.",
"Tip #4: \n\nCommanders rule the early stages of the battle, with their Dgun manual weapon they can decimate every unit with one blow.\nPress D to quckly initiate aiming.",
"Tip #5: \n\nSpread your buildings to prevent chained-explosions.\nPress ALT+Z and ALT+X to adjust auto-spacing.",
"Tip #6: \n\nIt is effective to move your units in spread formations.\nDrag your mouse while initiating a move order to draw multiple waypoints.",
"Tip #7: \n\nT2 factories are expensive, reclaim T1 lab for metal to fund it",
"Tip #8: \n\nAir strikes and airdrops may come anytime in the game, always have at least one anti-air unit in your base.",
"Tip #9: \n\nBA interface enables you to put labels on the map for other players to see.\n~(tilde)+doubleclick places a label with text.\n~(tilde)+middle mouse button puts an empty label.\n~(tilde)+mouse drag draws lines over the map. Use this for conducting coordinated team strategies and penises.",
"Tip #10: \n\nExpanding your territory is essential in gaining economic advantage over your opponent. Always try to reach for as many metal spots and geothermal vents as you can.",
"Tip #11:\n\nAlways think in advance about reclaiming the metal from wrecks piling up at the front.",
"Tip #12:\n\nIf your excessing energy build metal makers to convert it to metal.",
"Tip #13:\n\nYou can select all units of the same type by pressing CTRL+Z.",
"Tip #14: \n\nAlways watch out for your Commander.\nTo quickly select and center camera on your Commander press CRTL+C.",
"Tip #15: \n\nSingle-unit spam is easy to counter. Always try to include anti-air and support units in your army.",
"Tip #16:\n\nUnits and resources can be shared between team members. \n Double-click on tank icon next to the player's name to share units\nClick on metal/energy bar next to player's name to share resources.\nPress H to share an exact amount",
"Tip #17:\n\nIt is efficient to support your lab with constructors increasing its build-power. Right click on the factory with a constructor selected to guard (assist) with it",
"Tip #18:\n\nFor optimized expansion always try to keep all your builders busy.\nPress CTRL+B to select and center camera on your idle con.",
"Tip #19:\n\nThe best way to prevent air strikes is building fighters and putting them on PATROL in front of your base.",
"Tip #20:\n\nUse jammers to hide your units from enemy radars and hinder artillery strikes.",
"Tip #21:\n\nYou can cloak your Commander but remember it drains 500E every second and it's still visible to radars.\nPress C to turn CLOAK on.",
"Tip #22:\n\nCombine CLOAK with radar jamming to make your units fully stealth.",
"Tip #23:\n\nLong-ranged units need scouting for proper aiming. Accompany your artillery with a constant stream of quick/cheap units for better vision.",
"Tip #24:\n\nYou can assign units to groups by pressing CTRL+num. Select the group using numbers (from 1 to 9).",
"Tip #25:\n\nMastering hotkeys is the key to proficiency in BA.\nUse Z,X,C to quickly cycle between most frequently built structures, like mexes and defenses."}
-- Random unit descriptions we can show
local unit_descs = {"armck.dds Construction Kbot is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander and advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solars and most importantly the T2 Kbot lab. It is slightly slower and weaker than vehicle constructor, but it can climb steeper hills, so it is effective in expansion on mountainous terrain.",
"armflea.dds Fleas are supercheap and fast to build Kbots used for scouting and damaging the early eco structures of enemies. It is faster than all Kbots and most vehicles but any close confrontation will be lethal to it. Evade laser towers and destroy metal extractors to slow down your foeâ€™s expansion! ",
"armham.dds Hammer is a plasma Kbot that can deal a sizeable damage with relatively low cost of building. It has slightly higher HP than rocket Kbots, hence it can be used in big numbers to destroy T1 defensive structures. Combine with resurrection Kbots (Rectors), for an effective front push. Effective for defending mountain tops.",
"armjeth.dds Jethro is a cheap amphibious mobile anti-air (AA) Kbot, that can easily take down light aircrafts. Always send a few with your army to protect it from EMP drones/gunships. It has no land-to-land weapons.",
"armpw.dds Peewee is a basic infantry Kbot. Being very cheap to build and having high top speeds can be useful for scouting and taking down unguarded metal extractors and eco. In late T1 warfare Peewees can be used for ambushing Commanders and speedy skirmishing.",
"armrectr.dds Rector is a resurrection Kbot which can turn wrecks into brand new army members or reclaim them to get back your metal! It is fast and cheap to build, therefore it can serve as and ideal solution for reclaiming trees, rocks etc. Good for repairing damaged units too.",
"armrock.dds Rocko is a light rocket Kbot used mainly to push the frontline towards opponent's base. It can outrange light laser turrets so if your enemy expands solely with a Commander, Rockos can force him to retreat. Not effective against mobile units, watch out for A.K./Peewees!",
"armwar.dds Warrior is a durable Kbot armed with a rapid firing double laser. It has a relatively high HP for T1 and can easily take down multiple light assault units. Always combine with resurrection Kbots for healing and resurrecting fallen ones.",
"armatlas.dds Atlas is an airborne transportation unit. It can pick up all T1 land based units and T2, with exception of heavy ones, like Fatboy or Goliath. Use it for unexpected unit drops bypassing your enemy's defense line. Can be used for transporting nano towers too.",
"armca.dds Construction Aircraft is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander plus advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Aircraft Plant. Due to its speed it may be used for quick expansion and reclaiming in areas far from your base. Due to little build power you may want to use multiple air cons at once.",
"armfig.dds Freedom Fighter is a fast moving fighter jet that is designed for eliminating air units. It is the most effective form of T1 air defense. Always put your fighters on patrol in front of your base, so they attack any hostile aircraft moving in the vicinity. Send fighters with your bombing runs to disable opponent's fighter wall.",
"armkam.dds Banshee is a light gunship that can deal damage to land based units. It has very weak armor, that can be quickly shattered by T1 anti-air, so always send them in packs and scout before striking. It is a weapon of surprise, try to keep it away from your foe's radars. An effective attacking order is: nano towers -> AA towers and units -> eco and labs.",
"armpeep.dds Peeper is a cheap and fast moving air scout, that is not armed with any weapons, but a huge line of sight. It is used to gain intelligence on what your enemy is planning, and where he keeps his most important units. In late-game a constant stream of scouts helps your artillery units, improving their aim.",
"armthund.dds Thunder is a bomber, designed mainly for destroying buildings. A little bit weaker than its CORE counterpart - Shadow. It can strike every 9 seconds. Always scout first and combine with fighters to eliminate enemy's airwall before  bombing. Click A for attack and drag your RMB to execute a carpet bombing"}
