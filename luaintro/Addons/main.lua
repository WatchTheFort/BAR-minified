	"armfav.dds Jeffies are supercheap and fast to build vehicles used for scouting and damaging the early eco structures. It is the fastest moving unit in the whole game but due to light armor any close confrontation will be lethal to it. Evade laser towers and destroy metal extractors to slow down your foe's expansion.",
	"armflash.dds Flash is a light, fast moving tank with close combat rapid fire weapon. It is slightly more powerful and faster than Peewee and A.K. on flat terrain. Being very cheap to build and having high top speeds can be useful for scouting and taking down unguarded metal extractors and eco.",

Always put your fighters on patrol in front of your base, so they attack any hostile aircraft moving in the vicinity. Send fighters with your bombing runs to disable opponent's fighter wall.",
	"armkam.dds Banshee is a light gunship that can deal damage to land based units. It has very weak armor, that can be quickly shattered by T1 anti-air, so always send them in packs and scout before striking. It is a weapon of surprise, try to keep it away from your foe's radars. An effective attacking order is: nano towers -> AA towers and units -> eco and labs.",
	"armpeep.dds Peeper is a cheap and fast moving air scout, that is not armed with any weapons, but a huge line of sight. It is used to gain intelligence on what your enemy is planning, and where he keeps his most important units. In late-game a constant stream of scouts helps your artillery units, improving their aim.",
