Guide:

1. Create folders by following this path: Beyond-All-Reason/data/music/custom/*

2. In custom folder, create following folders: peace, warlow, warhigh, war, bossfight, gameover, menu, loading

3. Make sure your music is converted to .ogg format (there are plenty of online converters)

4. Copy all your ogg's to appropriate folders

Peace - Music that plays when there's no or very little combat going on. Also plays in menu.
WarLow - Music that plays when there's low intensity combat going on
WarHigh - Music that plays when there's high intensity combat going on
War - Music in this folder is added to both WarLow and WarHigh playlists
BossFight - Music that plays in final boss battle in Raptors and Scavengers gamemode
GameOver - Music played on the results screen
Menu - Music played in lobby. Add '(INTRO)' or '(intro)' to filenames of the song to define title themes.
Loading - Music that plays on battle loading screen.

You can also copy music directly to custom folder, which then gets added to all playlists except gameover and menu, but i don't recommend it.

5. You can turn off original soundtrack in Sound settings ingame.

For the music player to act correctly, please make sure you have at least one peace and one war track available if you want to turn off original soundtrack entirely.
