// Build special units when enemy_metal*ratio > response_metal*eps; eps=teamSize*eps_step+(1-eps_step)
// AA condition for 3v3: (enemy_air_metal*0.75 > (aa_metal+aa_cost)*2.6) and (aa_metal+aa_cost < army_metal*0.5)
//
// Probability of UnitDef for AA role depends on income tier: (tierN[UnitDef]+_weight_)*enemy_air_metal/aa_metal*importance
// armjeth probability for tier 1: (0.00+30.00)*enemy_air_metal*150.0
//
//
//ratio: 100% (ratio=1.0): means AI will invest the same amount of metal into response as enemy did in specific role. (=build until?). 
//ratio =3 => ai will invest up to 3x the metal like enemy has invested. high ratio reduce also build probability. in other words. ai build longer but with lower probabilty this unit
//importance: influences how much the build propability gets changed. the higher the value the higher the probability a this unit role gets build against the specific enemy unit
//
//IMPORTANCE & RATIO
//example:  build probability>: weight_=0.1, importance=25, factory probability 0.2
// response calculation p=(factory weight + responce weight) * importance / ratio
//probability = (0.2+0.1)*25/r, where r - ratio our_aa_metal/enemy_air_metal, but consider r=1 for specific time frame, then probabilities is 7.5 
//(0.2+0.1)\*25*enemy_air_metal/our_aa_metal 
//lets assume enemy_air_metal=const for some period of time, so as long as ai builds our_aa_metal the probability for AA response will decay slowly allowing some other response (anti static for example) to have more probability at some point.
//it's to allow other responses and not stuck on single one till it's full. Though it's also possible to stuck on 1 response if it's desired, by setting very high importance for that specific type of response.
//
//MAX PERCENT: for example AA, max_percent=1.0 means 100% of army may consist of AA; max_percent=0.3  ~ only 30% of whole army can be AA
//
//ROLE DEFINITTION
//SKIRMISH: good allround combat stats - good, dps & speed - Stumpy, Hammer
// RIOT: able to hit a lot of units via fast reload or aoe, fast targetting. - Zeus, Warrior, Leveler
// ASSAULT: first strong hit & good range. usually units with longer reload - Rocko, Banisher, Janus
// Heavy: much armor, powerfull weapon, sluggish?

//LOGIC
// high ratio => respond only ai
