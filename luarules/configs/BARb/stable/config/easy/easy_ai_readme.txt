brainstorm beginner behaviour and errors
- not expanding
- stalling/overflowing metal, e  => difficult to achieve that with config cause regulation of ressources is in the core program
- building non sense units (relying often on too much arty)
- building too much defense
- bad radar coverage
- low command rate (apm)
- increas buildspeed of nanos and cons =cons and nanos are builded later
- bad response

goals
- expansion: slow => less mobile builders, reduced com radius, building delay
- defensive play: no raiding, 
- unit production: low => building delay, only few 
- less eco: extending solars
- later tech upgrade



actual state:
- commmand delay => lower unit production and expansion rate
- less mobile builders => less expansion
- reduced com radius => less expansion with com. com stays in base. downturn is that com push factory production
- few nanos => lower unit production
- no early raiding: scouts and raiders have become skirmisher role
- energy production: relying heavy and for a long time on normal solars (which is not so efficient)
- more artillery => easy to kill and teach beginners to build units,get out of the base to hunt down units and not relying only on defense
- poor unit responce: respond only to air threat.
- does build much porc in a second phase. 
- does "over-protect" base with light defense
