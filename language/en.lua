Move them in line, because they can't shoot over each other.",
		cormlv = "The Spolier is a stealthy minelayer/minesweeper unit, that can make your base feel really safe. It produces light and heavy mines which are designed to eliminate different levels of threat. Light mines can stop Pewees, A.K., Flashes etc. and heavy can even stop most T2 units. IT's a cheap way to secure places where you don't have time to set up proper defenses, like your flanks. Always lay mines away from your opponent's line of sight and avoid having your own units on the minefield. To create effective minefields use Shift and drag with LMB while ordering a queue. REMEMBER that mines use energy to remain cloaked! Spoilers can also detonate enemy's mines using the attack command.",
		cormuskrat = "The Muskrat is an amphibious construction vehicle, which can travel on land and underwater equally well allowing easy expansion between islands, under rivers and across seas. Its build menu includes some water based units like underwater metal extractors, tidal generators and most importantly the amphibious complex, a lab that includes T2 amphibious tanks and Bots. As all amphibious units it can easily cross stepper hills unlike regular vehicles. It can be destroyed by torpedoes so avoid submarines, launchers and destroyers. It is wise to use pairs of cons for expansion, so they can heal each other and build defensive structures faster. This makes them immune to light assault units like fleas/jeffys.",
		cornecro = "Necro is a resurrection Bot which can turn wrecks into brand new  army members or reclaim them to get back your metal! It is fast and cheap to build, therefore it can serve as and ideal solution for reclaiming trees, rocks and other structures scattered across the map. It is essential to combine resurrection Bots with any attacking units so they can repair and resurrect/reclaim wrecks in real-time constantly reinforcing your army. It can be used to obtain constructors of the other fraction by resurrecting enemies wrecks.",
		corraid = "The Raider a medium assault tank. It has a relatively high hp so it should always be kept in the first line to sink in all damage. Useful for taking down light defenses with its sheer force. If not microed well, Raiders can be easily DGuned, so try to keep enemy Commanders at a distance. Combine with Slashers or artillery for a great frontline push or use large packs for raiding enemy bases. Don't forget to bring some constructors with your assault for repairing and reclaiming wrecks.",
		corshad = "The Shadow is a bomber, designed for destroying buildings. Its DPS is higher than that of ARM T1 bomber. It drops bombs over the target and makes a flyby to reload ammunition. It can strike every 9 seconds. Always scout first and combine with fighters to eliminate enemy's airwall before  bombing. Click A for attack and drag your RMB to execute a carpet bombing, or use area attack command to strike targets within a circle.",
		corstorm = "Storm is a light rocket Bot used mainly to push the frontline towards opponent's base. It can outrange light laser turrets so if your enemy expands solely with a Commander, Storms can force him to retreat. In bigger numbers and with repairing support of resurrection Bots they are able to take down more advanced defensive structures. Very ineffective against fast mobile units, watch out for A.K./Peewees! To protect them use your Commander/Constructors to build progressing defense. In comparison to their ARM counterpart (Rockos) they are a bit slower, but stonger at the same time",
		corthud = "Thud is a plasma Bot that can deal a sizeable damage with relatively low cost of building. It has a shorter range than rocket Bots, but if you manage to reach them, it can easily eliminate them. It has slightly higher HP than rocket Bots, hence it can be used in big numbers to destroy T1 defensive structures. Combine with resurrection Bots (Necros), for healing and resurrecting fallen units, to quickly push the frontline. Effective for defending mountain tops, as their range is longer when shooting downhill. Watch out for Heavy Laser Turrets.",
		corvalk = "The Valkyrie is an airborne transportation unit. It can pick up all T1 land based units and T2, with exception of heavy ones, like Fatboy or Goliath. Use it for unexpected unit drops bypassing your enemy's defense line, but don't forget to scout first for any anti air units. Drop your commander into their bases to Dgun all structures and humiliate your opponents. Can be used for transporting nano towers too, which enables you to move your build power where you currently need it.",
		corwolv = "Wolverine is an artillery vehicle used to take down T1 defenses, especially High Laser Turrets. It can outrange all T1 defense towers except coastal defense plasma batteries. Shooting its plasma shells along a parabolic trajectory they are obviously helpless in close quarters combat.  Always keep them protected by Levelers/Insstigators, or your own defensive structures. Don't forget to have targets in your radar's range or scouted.",
