## Development Quick Start

You will need a lobby for the Spring Engine, such as Spring Lobby. Once this is set up, go to your Spring data folder, and check out a copy of the game

```shell
git clone https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/Beyond-All-Reason.git bar.sdd
```

The game will now show in lobbies as `Beyond All Reason $VERSION`
