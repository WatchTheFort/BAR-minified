Balanced Annihilation is opensource and includes licenses of various kinds.

As a result you cannot modify/fork it and release it as your own game, at least not whithout removing BA branding, icons/screenshots/various particle effects/various widgets and gadgets.

Also on top of this there are forking rules set by the Spring RTS community.

We dont want to offer the posibility that anybody without deeper knowledge of the mechanics and logic beyond the surface of the game can make their own fork. Number-jockeys as developers are not desired. No game developer likes their art or code stolen, especially when the fork is offered on the same server, aiming to steal the playerbase as well. Cooperation and sharing resources between game devs is a good thing. Sharing playerbase via Spring RTS server is also good, but stealing a game and is not.

BA developers have put a lot (non balance related) work in this game and don't like that you can fork it disregarding everything else. If you want to fork BA you need to overhaul the game looks and behaviour so it no longer resembles or is close to BA. We need to protect the work and the continuity of the project against hostile takeovers that disregard all efforts outside balancing.
